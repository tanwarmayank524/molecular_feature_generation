# molecular_feature_generation
A collection of codes to generate novel steric features for homogeneous catalysis, acting as descriptors for both activity and selectivity. These molecular features were initially developed for hydrogen atom transfer reactions, and extensions to other homogeneous reactions are currently underway. 


## input file
The input file(s) contain atomic coordinates for the corresponding atoms in a molecule/ molecule group.
