# molecular_feature_generation
Collection of codes to analyze periodic ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The scripts are currently tailored to the output generated from the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP), but the input files can also be formatted for other software. These generalized codes work for simulation boxes in the cartesian geometry where the lattice vectors are orthogonal. These codes are being continuously developed, and more features will be added soon.


## input file
The XDATCAR file generated by VASP after an AIMD run is first formatted with the command below and then copied to a .xlsx file to use with the scripts. The command to delete the 'Direct Configuration' line from XDATCAR:

```sed -i '/Direct/d' XDATCAR```


## bond length
bond_length.py tracks the bond distance between two atoms during a periodic ab initio molecular dynamics simulation. The script can be run with:

```python bond_length.py *XDATCAR.xlsx atom1 atom2 OUTPUT.png```

Here, atom1 and atom2 are the indexes of the atom whose bond is being monitored, and OUTPUT.png gives the evolution of the bond length for simulation. *XDATCAR.xlsx is the input file.
