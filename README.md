# molecular_feature_generation
A collection of codes to generate novel steric features for homogeneous catalysis, acting as descriptors for both activity and selectivity. These molecular features were initially developed for hydrogen atom transfer reactions, and extensions to homogeneous reactions are currently underway. 


## input file
The XDATCAR file generated by VASP after an AIMD run is first formatted with the command below and then copied to a .xlsx file to use with the scripts. The command to delete the 'Direct Configuration' line from XDATCAR:

```sed -i '/Direct/d' XDATCAR```


## bond length
bond_length.py tracks the bond distance between two atoms during a periodic ab initio molecular dynamics simulation. The script can be run with:

```python bond_length.py *XDATCAR.xlsx atom1 atom2 OUTPUT.png```

Here, atom1 and atom2 are the indexes of the atom whose bond is being monitored, and OUTPUT.png gives the evolution of the bond length for simulation. *XDATCAR.xlsx is the input file.
